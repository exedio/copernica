# This is the default test database configuration
# of the cope project. You can easily add more
# databases for testing by creating more files
# named *.test.cope.properties. How to write such
# a file see cope.properties.example.

database=hsqldb
database.url=jdbc:hsqldb:.
database.user=sa
database.password=
#database.log=true

# The parameter x-build.driver is used in the cope
# build process only. In a normal cope project you
# have to care about having the jdbc driver in the
# classpath yourself.
#
x-build.driver=hsqldb.jar

# The parameter x-build.skip.lib.teardown is used
# in the cope build process only. It makes the
# ant target "teardown" ignore this database
# configuration.
